Django's generic class based view implementation is unneccesarily complicated.

Django vanilla views gives you the same benefits of using class based views, but with:

* No mixin classes.
* No calls to `super()`.
* A sane class heirarchy.
* A stripped down API.
* Simpler method implementations, with less magical behavior.

Note that the package does not yet include the date based generic views.

`django-vanilla-views` should currently be considered in draft.  A properly tested and documented beta release is planned.

# Installation

Install using pip.

    pip install django-vanilla-views

Import and use the views.

    from vanilla import ListView, DetailView
