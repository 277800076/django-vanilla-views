Django's generic class based view implementation is unneccesarily complicated.

Django vanilla views gives you the same benefits of using class based views, but with:

* No mixin classes.
* No calls to `super()`.
* A sane class heirarchy.
* A stripped down API.
* Simpler method implementations, with less magical behavior.

Note that the package does not yet include the date based generic views.

`django-vanilla-views` should currently be considered in draft.  A properly tested and documented beta release is planned.

**The release announcement and further details on `django-vanilla-views` are [available here](http://dabapps.com/blog/fixing-djangos-generic-class-based-views/).**

# Installation

Install using pip.

    pip install django-vanilla-views

# Usage

Import and use the views.

    from vanilla import ListView, DetailView

The project code is listed below as an example of using `django-vanilla-views`.

**views.py**

	from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse_lazy
	from example.notes.models import Note
	from vanilla import CreateView, DeleteView, ListView, UpdateView
	
	class ListNotes(ListView):
	    model = Note
	
	
	class CreateNote(CreateView):
	    model = Note
	    success_url = reverse_lazy('list_notes')
	
	
	class EditNote(UpdateView):
	    model = Note
	    success_url = reverse_lazy('list_notes')
	
	
	class DeleteNote(DeleteView):
	    model = Note
	    success_url = reverse_lazy('list_notes')
	
	
	list_notes = ListNotes.as_view()
	create_note = CreateNote.as_view()
	edit_note = EditNote.as_view()
	delete_note = DeleteNote.as_view()

**urls.py**

	from django.conf.urls import patterns, include, url
	from example.notes.models import Note
	
	urlpatterns = patterns('example.notes.views',
	    url(r'^$', 'list_notes', name='list_notes'),
	    url(r'^create/$', 'create_note', name='create_note'),
	    url(r'^edit/(?P<pk>\d+)/$', 'edit_note', name='edit_note'),
	    url(r'^delete/(?P<pk>\d+)/$', 'delete_note', name='delete_note'),
	)
